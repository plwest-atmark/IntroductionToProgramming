  This is a standard JSON file. 

    JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
    JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
    JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.

    This file is used for configuration of your websites.  It is one of many configuration methods
      that can be used when configuring a web application and one of the main configuration methods
      since it is easy to use and understand.  The settings can be configured per deployment environment.
      This means that on my Development Environment I can have one configuration, but on my Production
      or Staging environments, I can have a different configuration.  Included with this appsettings.json
      is also an appsettings.development.json and an appsettings.production.json.  Based on which environment
      the web application is hosted and running on, will determine which configuration will be used.  This is
      an important concept for configuration setup, since there are different reasons to have different
      configurations in each environment.

  // This is a more complex setting that has another "object" inside of the {}.
  // In this case, if you retreive the "Logging" setting, you will get the
  // "LogLevel" as an object that has the Default, Information and Error Key/Value pairs in a list. 
  // This can be complex and the complexity of the object that can be created is not limited. 
  // However, for clarity we try to keep our settings and JSON files simple so they can be read easily.
